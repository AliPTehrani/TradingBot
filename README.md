The main idea that i wanted to test was:
  - When big Crypto Currency exchanges release the news that a new coin will be listed the prices of the coin should pump
  - I scraped the announcement page of Binance and wanted to see how the prices change after the release of the listing
  - I stopped the developement of this bot since the price of the coins increased BEFORE the news article was published ... ( insider trading ? :D )
